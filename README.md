> A reading habit builder iOS mobile application

## Users ##
  > This mobile application is for users who want to jumpstart their reading journey through daily reading streaks by number of pages read or duration of reading within a given day. The application leverages on user-data to showcase their progress. 

## The Problem ##
  > Inspired by this [documentary by Max Joseph](https://youtu.be/lIW5jBrrsS0), this mobile app wants to encourage users to read more books despite being constantly distracted by widely available, digestible, online information. 

## The Solution ##
  > The application hopes to disable phone usage for a set duration, allowing the users to spend their time reading their current book distraction-free. The application guides the users to track their reading journey through a beautiful dashboard, a library displaying all the books they have read, and a bookmarking functionality.
